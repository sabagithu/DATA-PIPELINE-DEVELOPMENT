# 🚢 Titanic Dataset ETL Project

## 📌 Project Overview
This project demonstrates an end-to-end ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline using the Titanic dataset. The objective is to process raw data into a clean, structured format suitable for analysis and machine learning tasks.

The workflow showcases essential data handling skills including data extraction, preprocessing, transformation, and export. It serves as a foundational example for data science and data engineering practices.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- **Extract** the Titanic dataset from source.
- **Transform** the data by handling missing values, standardizing formats, and encoding categorical variables.
- **Load** the cleaned dataset into a structured CSV file for future use.

---

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies Used
- **Python 3.x**
- **Jupyter Notebook**
- **Pandas** – data manipulation
- **NumPy** – numerical computations
- **Matplotlib / Seaborn** – basic EDA visualization
- **OpenPyXL** – Excel file handling (if applicable)

---

## 📂 Project Workflow

### 🔹 Data Extraction
- Loaded the Titanic dataset into a Pandas DataFrame.

### 🔹 Data Transformation
- Removed irrelevant columns.
- Handled missing values in `Age`, `Cabin`, and `Embarked`.
- Encoded categorical variables such as `Sex` and `Embarked`.
- Standardized column names for consistency.

### 🔹 Data Loading
- Exported the cleaned dataset as a `.csv` file for downstream analysis or modeling.
